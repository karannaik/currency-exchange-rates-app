# Currency Exchange Calculator


A currency exchange calculator app built to demonstrate using redux with react hooks. This was developed when I completed this course: https://egghead.io/lessons/react-refactor-to-use-action-type-constants-and-action-creators-when-dispatching-redux-actions. Thanks Jamund!

### Setup

`npm install`

### Run It

`npm start`

This app was built using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) and relies on [exchangeratesapi.io](https://exchangeratesapi.io/).
